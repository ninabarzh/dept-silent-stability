# IOC generation

## Disclaimer

All code in this module that generates IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) is intended
solely for simulation and testing within the simulator environment. It is not
guaranteed to reflect real-world threat feeds or operational accuracy.

While the generated IOCs can be useful for learning, experimentation, and
getting started with real-world threat analysis, they should never be used as
the sole basis for production security decisions.

Use at your own risk. Always validate and supplement with trusted, real-world
sources when applying threat intelligence in operational environments.
